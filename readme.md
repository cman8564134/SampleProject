This project was created for me to self-learn Laravel, one of the most popular PHP framework. It also gives me an opportunity to learn/master another language and deepen my knowledge of web/application development. This is a sample project is used to contain all my knowledge of Laravel through self-learning. I have went through several online materials/courses to learn Laravel and develop this application.
